### What is `Redstonery Mod`?

Redstonery Mod is a Minecraft mod allowing users to select and save in-world creations in the format required for the Redstonery AI models.

### Where can I get it?

The mod will be soon available on Modrinth at https://modrinth.com/mod/redstonery/. There you can download the latest version or you can find it in the Modrinth launcher.\
For now, you can download the `.jar` file from the releases section on the sidebar on this mod's GitHub page.

### How do I use it?

After installing the mod and loading a world you can take the `Redstone Selector` from the redstone tab in the creative menu.

You can right-click and left-click to place two corners of the selection box.

If you can't find the selection you can sneak to make the selection render through walls.
